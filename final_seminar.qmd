# Introduction

- **Overview of PhD Research**:
  - This research focuses on two distinct, but interconnected areas of study: spatial epidemiology and socio-economic status measurement.
  - The first part introduces a longitudinal socio-economic index to better capture changes over time, enhancing traditional measures which are typically static.
  - The second part addresses the use of advanced statistical models to improve disease mapping, particularly focusing on the challenges of data sparsity.
  
- **Goal**: Contributions to public health and socio-economic analysis through statistical modeling.
