# Introduction

- **Overview of PhD Research**:
  - This research focuses on two distinct, but interconnected areas of study: socio-economic status measurement and advanced spatial model in small area estimation
  - The first part introduces a longitudinal socio-economic index to better capture changes over time, enhancing traditional measures which are typically static.
  - The second part addresses the use of advanced statistical models to improve disease mapping and small area estimation, particularly focusing on the challenges of data sparsity and bivariate outcomes.
  
- **Aims**: Contributions to public health and socio-economic analysis through statistical modeling by:
  - Creation of a socio-economic index that allows longitudinal analysis.
  - Bayesian analysis using copulas for capturing heterogeneity.


:::{.notes}

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the final seminar of my PhD research. Thank you for joining me today.

I’ll be presenting the scope and outcomes of my research, which covers two distinct but related areas: socio-economic status measurement and advanced spatial modeling for small area estimation.

First, I developed a longitudinal socio-economic index that allows us to track socio-economic status more effectively over time. This index is designed to be consistent across different periods, offering a clearer view of how socio-economic status shifts over time.

In the second part of my research, I explored advanced statistical models to improve the accuracy of disease mapping and small area estimation. Specifically, I used Bayesian analysis with copulas to capture complex relationships in the data. I then translated this new approach into an R package to make it accessible for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Throughout the presentation, I’ll look into each of these areas, motiavtions of them, discussing the methods, insights, and contributions my work offers to these fields.

# Part One: Constructing a Socio-Economic Index for Longitudinal Analysis

## Background and Socio-Economic Indices

- Composite indices are widely used in socio-economic research

To measure socio-economic status is a complex task, as it is a multidimensional concept that encompasses various aspects of life, such as income, education, occupation and house conditions [@Zagorski1986Demographic]. Constructing a composite index is a common approach to measure socio-economic status, as it can provide a single summary measure that captures the multidimensional nature of socio-economic status.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common method to construct composite indices

When given multiple indicators of socio-economic status, PCA can be used to construct a composite index by providing a linear combination of the indicators that maximizes the variance of the data. The first principal component is often used as the composite index, as it captures the most variation in the data, where this variation is assumed to be related to socio-economic status [@Mazziotta2019Use].


:::{.notes}

Composite indices are widely used in socio-economic research to measure complex concepts like socio-economic status. By combining multiple indicators into a single measure, these indices offer a comprehensive view of the concept being studied.

A common method for creating composite indices is Principal Component Analysis, or PCA. PCA identifies the combination of variables that captures the most variation, allowing us to condense multiple indicators into a single summary measure.

For socio-economic status, using PCA helps create an index that reflects its multidimensional aspects, like income, education, and occupation. This approach makes it easier to analyze and interpret socio-economic data in a meaningful way.

## Historical Review of the SEIFA-IRSD

- The current recognized form of SEIFA first appeared in 1986 and has been updated every five years since then.

Five indices are produced from 1986 to 1996, where there were two different indices produced for urban and rural areas for measuring socio-economic advantage and disadvantage. ABS justifies this urban/rural split, citing significant structural differences between variables in urban and rural areas.

- The 2001 SEIFA replaced two indices with one, which was the IRSAD. And four indices were produced since then until 2021, which are IRSD, IRSAD, IEO and IER.

Among these indexes, the IRSD is regarded as the most established and widely used, as it encompasses all available variables that reflect or measure socio-economic disadvantage [@SEIFA2001]. Furthermore, the IRSD is recognized for its consistency, as it has maintained a nearly identical methodological approach and variables in its construction process across various periods [@SEIFA2001; @SEIFA2021].


:::{.notes}

In Australia, the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas, or SEIFA, have served as a key tool for measuring socio-economic status since 1986. Updated every five years, SEIFA provides a comprehensive view of socio-economic conditions across different regions.

Initially, SEIFA included various indices to capture socio-economic differences between urban and rural areas. However, in 2001, these indices were consolidated into a single, more streamlined index known as the Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD). Since then, SEIFA has been regularly updated to reflect current socio-economic trends.

Among the four indices created since 2001, the Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD) stands out for its widespread use and reliability. Focused specifically on measuring disadvantage, the IRSD has maintained a consistent methodology and variable selection across updates, making it a trusted tool in socio-economic analysis.

**Remarks on Variable Selection**

- **Addition of Variables**
    - `CHILDJOBLESS` was added from 2011, which quantifies the percentage of families with children under age 15 and parents without employment

- **Removal of Variables**
    - `RENT_SOCIAL` was removed from 2011, since its skewed distribution and relatively high non-response rate made it less reliable as an indicator of socio-economic status.
    - `INDIGENOUS` was removed from 2011, as it was deemed to be a sensitive variable that could lead to complex interpretations issues.
    - `NONET` was removed from 2021, as it was removed from the Census data collection, since having a fixed Internet connection was no longer a reliable indicator of socio-economic status, as many people now use mobile devices and other ways to access the Internet.

- **Changes in Variable Definitions**
    - `NOQUAL` was changed to `NOYR12ORHIGHER`, `NOSCHOOL` was changed to `NOEDU` from 2011, to better reflect the educational attainment of the population.

- **Changes in Variable Reference Value**
    - `INC_LOW` and `LOWRENT` had their reference values changed in each period with no pattern (not uniform, not distribution-based, not inflation-adjusted), which makes it difficult to compare the index across different periods.

<div style="font-size: 0.65em;">

| **Wave** | **INC_LOW Reference Level**                                  | **LOWRENT Reference Level**                         |

</div>

:::{.notes}

Let’s take a closer look at the variables used in the IRSD index over time. These variables capture aspects of income, education, employment, and housing to reflect socio-economic status.

In 2006, the IRSD included 17 variables like income levels, education, and employment status. Over time, some variables have been added, removed, or modified based on relevance and data quality. For example, CHILDJOBLESS was added in 2011 to capture families with jobless parents, while RENT_SOCIAL and INDIGENOUS were removed due to concerns over data quality and interpretation.

In 2021, NONET was removed, as internet access no longer serves as a reliable socio-economic indicator. Such adjustments ensure the index remains relevant to current standards.

A key issue is the changing reference values for variables like INC_LOW and LOWRENT, which complicates comparisons over time and highlights the need for standardized reference values to maintain consistency across years.

### Geographical Boundary Changes

- **Two systems of geographical boundaries in Australia**
    - **ASGC**: Australian Standard Geographical Classification before 2011
    - **ASGS**: Australian Statistical Geography Standard after 2011, updated every five year

- **SEIFA based on areal units**
    - **CD**: Census Collection District (ASGC) in 2006
    - **SA1**: Statistical Area Level 1 (ASGS) in 2011 - 2021
    - **Larger spatial units**: Population weighted average of CD/SA1

- **Exclusions of areas with rules**
    - **Non-residential and high non-response rates areas**: such as airports, ports, and military bases
    - **One more phrase of exclusions in 2011, 2016, 2021**: areas with less than 6 denominator in the calculation of the index

**Number of Valid Areas in Constructing Index**

When comparing the index, all index will be converted into the same geographical standard, which is SA2 ASGS 2021. The conversion process is done by population-weighted average provided by correspondence files from ABS [@SEIFACorrespondences]

: Number of Valid Areas in Constructing IRSD and L-IRSD {#tbl-valid-areas}

</div>


:::{.notes}

An important consideration in constructing the IRSD index is the geographical boundaries used. Australia has used two classification systems: the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) before 2011 and the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) since 2011, updated every five years.

The ABS produces the SEIFA IRSD index using areal units like Census Collection Districts (CD) and Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) to capture socio-economic data. For consistency, these are converted to larger units like SA2 ASGS 2021 using population-weighted averages.

Some areas are excluded from the index—such as non-residential zones or regions with high non-response rates. Since 2011, additional exclusions apply to areas with fewer than six denominator values, ensuring reliability.

The table shows the number of valid areas for each period, aligning geographical standards to SA2 ASGS 2021 for consistent comparison across years.

**Remarks**

- **Proportion of Variance Explained**
    - IRSD accounted for 39% of the variation among variables in 2006, changing to 44% in 2011, 43% in 2016, and 37% in 2021

- **Loading Trends**
    - Stability in the loadings of certain variables—such as `DISABILITYU70`, `SEPDIVORCED`, `ENGLISHPOOR`, `LOWRENT`, `NOYEAR12ORHIGHER`, `NOEDU`, `OCC_DRIVER`, and `OVERCROWD`
    - `CHILDJOBLESS` and `ONEPARENT` have decreasing loadings over time - may be linked to changing societal attitudes towards marriage and divorce [@Tucker2008Enduring] and improvements in the welfare system for single-parent families [@Chiappori2006Divorce; @Herbst2016Mothers]
    - `INC_LOW` increased significantly between 2011 and 2016.


:::{.notes}

This plot shows the loading of each variable in the IRSD index across different years. A variable's loading reflects its contribution to the index, with higher values indicating greater importance.

The IRSD index captures a substantial share of socio-economic variance, explaining 39% of variation in 2006, increasing to 44% in 2011, 43% in 2016, and 37% in 2021. This indicates the index’s effectiveness in representing socio-economic status across periods.

The graph highlights stable variables like DISABILITYU70, SEPDIVORCED, and ENGLISHPOOR, which consistently contribute to the index. Meanwhile, variables like CHILDJOBLESS and ONEPARENT show decreasing loadings, possibly reflecting societal changes and the impact of welfare policies on single-parent families.

Additionally, INC_LOW shows a notable increase in loading from 2011 to 2016, pointing to a growing emphasis on income levels in assessing socio-economic status.

### Limitations and Motivations for Longitudinal analysis

**Challenges for Longitudinal Analysis**

- **Inconsistent Variable Selection**: The selection of variables for the index can vary across different years due to changes in data availability, definitions, or relevance.
    
- **Reference Value Shift**: The reference value of each variable may change over time due to shifts in data collection methods, definitions, or population characteristics.

- **Spatial Boundary Changes**: Changes in spatial boundaries, such as the merging or splitting of regions, can affect the comparability of data across years. Another issue that arises from the spatial boundary changes is the population distribution.

- **Standardization Issues**: The standardization of variables may vary across years due to changes in data collection methods or definitions. Inconsistent standardization can lead to discrepancies in the index's representation of socio-economic status over time.

- **Pattern Shift**: The underlying patterns of socio-economic status may shift over time due to changes in economic conditions, social policies, or population characteristics. In detail, some variables may have different importance in different years, which may lead to the different interpretation of the index.


**Motivations**

In response to these challenges, we aim to develop an index that can longitudinally capture socio-economic status variance in Australia

- **Consistency**: Based on the framework of the SEIFA as Australia provide one of the most comprehensive socio-economic indices with technical details and data availability and SEIFA is widely used in the research community with clear and transparent methodology

- **Comparability**: The new index LIRSD and WLIRSD should be able to comparing with the traditional widely used SEIFA index, and can be used to track the socio-economic status of areas over time

- **Secondary Finding**: Analysis the potential role of the second principal component of the constructed index

:::{.notes}

Our review of the SEIFA IRSD index reveals several challenges for longitudinal analysis of socio-economic status. Key issues include inconsistent variable selection, shifts in reference values, spatial boundary changes, standardization issues, and evolving patterns over time.

While many of these limitations were discussed in earlier slides, I want to briefly touch on standardization issues here. Standardizing variables before applying PCA is essential to ensure comparability, as it places all variables on the same scale. However, if standardization is done separately for each period, it can compromise the comparability of the index over time.

To overcome these challenges, our goal is to develop a new index that captures socio-economic status consistently across time in Australia. This new index will build on the SEIFA framework, aiming to be consistent, comparable, and transparent—ensuring both reliability and relevance for longitudinal socio-economic analysis.

## Development of the Longitudinal IRSD (L-IRSD) and PC2 Index

**Trade-off between static and dynamic variable weights [@liborio2022principal]**

- **Single Indicator Approach**: A single weights is determined and applied across all time period, which prioritize comparability, assuming the importance of variable on SES remains stable.

- **Multiple Indicator Approach**: Weights are determined for each time period, which prioritize the capturing of the changing chracteristics of SES over time. But hard to compare the index across different time period.

- **Structured Indicator Approach**: This method was designed to maintain both dynamic socio-economic context representation and temporal comparability when comparing two time periods. When there are only two time periods, two indicators are created. The first indicator is constructed using PCA as usual, and the second indicator is built using the eigenvalue from the first PCA model and the standardized variables from the second period.


:::{.notes}

When creating a longitudinal socio-economic index, we face a trade-off in how we handle variable weights over time. We can use one of three approaches: Single Indicator, Multiple Indicator, or Structured Indicator.

The Single Indicator Approach uses the same weights for each period, making comparisons easier but possibly missing changes in socio-economic patterns.

The Multiple Indicator Approach allows weights to change over time, capturing shifts in socio-economic status. However, this makes cross-period comparisons harder.

Finally, the Structured Indicator Approach balances stable and changing weights, but it requires that the first principal component explains more than 50% of the variance, which our data doesn’t meet—so we didn’t use this method.

:::


---
**Choose the Single Indicator Approach for L-IRSD**

- The ABS clearly adapted the **Multiple Indicator Approach** when producing SEIFA

- **Structured Indicator Approach** is not suitable here as when there are more than two time periods, the number of indicators will increase exponentially. And is is only recommended when the explained variance of the first principal component is greater than 50% [@liborio2022principal].

- We choose the **Single Indicator Approach** for the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD, as it aligns with our objective.

:::{.notes}

The SEIFA by the ABS uses the Multiple Indicator Approach, which is good for capturing changes in socio-economic status over time. However, the Structured Indicator Approach isn’t a fit for our data, as it requires a high level of explained variance that we don’t have.

For our indices, L-IRSD and WL-IRSD, we chose the Single Indicator Approach. This approach makes it easier to compare socio-economic status consistently across different time periods, helping us track changes over time more effectively.

: List of Variables for Constructing IRSD across 2006-2021 {#tbl-variable-list}

</div>


Data obtained from *TableBuilder* from the ABS [@TableBuilder].

- `INC_LOW` and `LOWRENT` are excluded from as the reference value of these variables can not be customized in the *TableBuilder*

- `OVERCROWD` is excluded since it is not accessible in the 2006 and 2011

- `CHILDJOBLESS` is excluded since it is not accessible in the 2006

This careful exclusion strategy is essential to maintaining the index’s longitudinal consistency and robustness, even in light of certain data unavailability. Nevertheless, keeping there eleven variables in the L-IRSD ensures that the index remains comprehensive and representative of socio-economic status across different periods.

:::{.notes}

The L-IRSD index is built using eleven variables that remain consistent across time periods, with data sourced from the ABS TableBuilder.

Some variables were excluded due to data limitations or customization issues. For instance, INC_LOW and LOWRENT were excluded because their reference values couldn’t be customized. OVERCROWD was unavailable in 2006 and 2011, and CHILDJOBLESS was unavailable in 2006, so these variables were also excluded.

### Alignment of Geographic Boundaries

We align the raw (count) data from each census wave to the SA2 under the ASGS 2021. The conversion process is done by population-weighted average provided by correspondence files from ABS [@SEIFACorrespondences].

- Explicit guidelines are available for converting data from older geographical standards to the new framework, facilitated by a detailed correspondence table. 

- A significant objective of small area estimation research is to support forecasting the latest geographical standard allows for more accurate projections based on current data. This approach ensures that the L-IRSD is both historically consistent and relevant for future applications.

Exclusion rules after translating the original data to the SA2s under the ASGS 2021 framework

- Omitting areas where any variable has a denominator smaller than 6, which is a logical choice, mirroring the ABS’s own exclusion rule.

:::{.notes}

To ensure consistency and comparability, we align data from each census wave to SA2 under ASGS 2021. We use ABS correspondence files for this, which provide population-weighted averages for each area.

After converting to this geographical standard, we apply exclusion rules. Specifically, we omit areas where any variable has a denominator smaller than 6, following the ABS’s own criteria.

### Overall Procedure for Constructing L-IRSD

![Flowchart of constructing LIRSD and WLIRSD](notebooks/figures/steps.png){#fig-LIRSD-flowchart}

:::{.notes}

This flowchart shows the steps for constructing the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices.

First, we select variables and download the source data. We align the data to SA2 ASGS 2021 using population-weighted averages and apply exclusion rules to ensure data quality.

Next, we standardize the variables and apply PCA to create the L-IRSD index. The WL-IRSD follows the same process.

Finally, we select the first principal component from the PCA as the L-IRSD index. The second component, PC2, is also saved for future analysis.

:::


## Results of LIRSD and WLIRSD

Results will be analyzed in four aspects:

- **Proportion of Variation Explained**: The proportion of variation explained by the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD will be compared to the IRSD across different years.

- **Loading of Variables on PC1 and PC2**: The loadings of variables in the L-IRSD and WLIRSD will be compared to the IRSD across different years.

- **Cluster Analysis on areas based on PC1 and PC2**: The clustering of SA2s based on the PC1 and PC2 of the L-IRSD and WLIRSD will be compared to the IRSD across different years.

- **Comparison of (W)L-IRSD with IRSD and Trend Analysis**: The L-IRSD and WLIRSD will be compared to the IRSD across different years.


:::{.notes}

After constructing the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices, we analyze and validate them through four key aspects:

Proportion of Variation Explained – to check if the index effectively captures socio-economic status.
Variable Loadings on PC1 and PC2 – to see each variable’s contribution to the index.
Cluster Analysis – to group areas with similar socio-economic characteristics based on PC1 and PC2.
Comparison with IRSD and Trend Analysis – to assess the consistency and relevance of the new indices over time.
These steps ensure the robustness and applicability of our indices.

- `WLISD` show a higher proportion of variation explained by PC1 compared to `L-IRSD` and `IRSD` across different years, which is consistent with the expectation that the weighted index should better capture the socio-economic status of the areas.

- The proportion of variation explained by PC2 around 20% in `L-IRSD` and `WLIRSD` across different years, which reveals the potential of PC2 in capturing the socio-economic status of the areas.

- The higher value within each year compared to the overall value make sense as the they may have same pattern within each year, but different pattern across different years.


:::{.notes}

This table shows the proportion of variation explained by the IRSD, L-IRSD, and WL-IRSD indices across different years. The L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices capture a higher proportion of variation than the IRSD, indicating their stronger effectiveness in representing socio-economic status.

We also observe that PC2 explains around 20% of the variation in the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices. This suggests that PC2 may play a notable role in capturing socio-economic patterns—a factor not discussed in the ABS SEIFA documentation or other studies.

Correlation Circle of Variables on PC1 and PC2 for L-IRSD and WLIRSD
:::

- **Orthogonal Relationship**: PC2 is always orthogonal to PC1, which means that the interpretation of PC2 should be somewhat independent of PC1.

- **PC1 Loading**
    - All loadings are in the same direction, which is good for the interpretation of the index.
    - The variables `OCC LABOUR`, `ONEPARENT`, and `DISABILITYU70` show the highest loadings. This is followed closely by
`UNEMPLOYED` and occupation-related variables like `OCC_DRIVERS` and `OCC_SERVICE_L`.
    - `NOYEAR12ORHIGHER` and `NOEDU` are moderate
    - `ENGLISHPOOR` and `NOCAR` have the lowest loadings

- **PC2 Loading**
    - Some loading are in opposite direction with each other, however, there are **clusters** of variables that have similar loading patterns.
    -  `ENGLISHPOOR` and `NOCAR` cluster together, revealing a lifestyle or demographic grouping where English proficiency and vehicle ownership are common attributes
    - `ONEPARENT`, `SEPDIVORCED`, and `DISABILITYU70` cluster together, indicating a socio-economic grouping where single-parent families, divorced individuals, and those with disabilities are prevalent
    - The above two clusters are in opposite direction in PC2, which means that there are two different types of disadvantage in the socio-economic status occurs in different areas
    - The diverse between `NOEDU` and `NOYEAR12ORHIGHER` is also interesting, indicating the lack of different level of education may refers to different types of disadvantage in the socio-economic status

:::{.notes}

This figure shows the correlation circle of variables on PC1 and PC2 for the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices.

In PC1, all variables point in the same direction, making it straightforward to interpret the index. The variables with the highest loadings are OCC LABOUR, ONEPARENT, and DISABILITYU70, followed by UNEMPLOYED, OCC DRIVERS, and OCC SERVICE_L. NOYEAR12ORHIGHER and NOEDU have moderate loadings, while ENGLISHPOOR and NOCAR show the lowest.

PC2 presents a more interesting pattern. Here, some variables load in opposite directions, forming clusters with similar loading patterns. For example, ENGLISHPOOR and NOCAR cluster together, suggesting a shared lifestyle or demographic grouping. Meanwhile, ONEPARENT, SEPDIVORCED, and DISABILITYU70 form another cluster, likely representing a socio-economic grouping. The opposite directions of these clusters in PC2 reveal different types of socio-economic disadvantage across areas.

Scatter plot of PC1 and PC2 of Observations across SA2s for L-IRSD and WLIRSD
:::

- **SA2s with High Contribution to PC1:** In PCA analysis, high contribution of PC1 on units means this units was represented by the PC1 well, which we highlight them with label on @fig-LIRSD-ind and @fig-WLIRSD-ind
    
    - **TYPE 1:** Functional areas of urban centers, with high proportion of certain occupations and low educational attainment
    
    *Elizabeth*, *Smithfield - Elizabeth North*, *Bridge - Gagebrook* and *Logan Central*
    
    - **TYPE 2:** Areas with high proportion of first nations people with unique cultural and social characteristics
    
    *Yarrabah*, *East Arnhem*, *Yuendumu - Anmatjere* and *Sandover - Plenty*
    
    - **TYPE 3:** Areas with high proportion of immigrants with low English proficiency and car ownership
    
    *Cabramatta-Lansvale*, *Inala - Richlands*, *Ashcroft - Busby - Miller*, *Smithfield - Elizabeth North*, and *Davoren Park*

- **Capital vs. Non-Capital areas**
    - Both capital and non-capital areas spread across different levels of PC1, indicating that disadvantage is not limited to only capital or only non-capital areas
    
    - However, capital areas tend to have higher PC2 values, indicating a different type of disadvantage compared to non-capital areas
    
    - Also, this founding enlighten the importance of PC2 in capturing the urban-rural differences in socio-economic status

:::{.notes}

In addition to the correlation circle, we analyzed the scatter plot of PC1 and PC2 across SA2s for the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices.

Highlighted observations are based on contribution, a metric indicating how well each area is represented by the principal components. After reviewing the community profiles of these SA2s, we identified three types of areas based on their contribution to PC1:

Type 1: Functional urban centers, often near airports, with high concentrations in specific occupations and lower education levels—examples include Elizabeth, Smithfield - Elizabeth North, Bridge - Gagebrook, and Logan Central.

Type 2: Areas with high proportions of First Nations people, reflecting unique cultural and social characteristics, such as Yarrabah, East Arnhem, Yuendumu - Anmatjere, and Sandover - Plenty.

Type 3: Areas with high proportions of immigrants with low English proficiency and car ownership, such as Cabramatta-Lansvale, Inala - Richlands, Ashcroft - Busby - Miller, and Davoren Park.

This classification shows that our new index captures different types of socio-economic disadvantage effectively.

We also colored the points to differentiate capital and non-capital areas. The spread across PC1 suggests that disadvantage isn’t exclusive to either capital or non-capital areas. However, capital areas tend to have higher PC2 values, indicating a different kind of disadvantage compared to non-capital areas.

### Comparison of (W)L-IRSD with IRSD and Trend Analysis

![](notebooks/figures/PCA/B07_ScoreCompar_SA2_WPCA.png){#fig-WLIRSD-compare}

Scatter between IRSD and L-IRSD, WLIRSD at SA2
:::

- Diagonal line represents the scores of IRSD and (W)L-IRSD are the same, and the points above the line means the score of (W)L-IRSD are higher than IRSD, and the points below the line means the score of (W)L-IRSD are lower than IRSD

- **Convergence vs. Divergence**
    
    - Trend lines of both capital and non-capital areas nearly converge with diagnal in 2006, but become more and more divergent as time goes on
    
    - The flattening of trend lines for non-capital areas suggests that, although these areas still face socio-economic challenges, their level of disadvantage has decreased over time—reflected in improved scores when considered longitudinally.
    
    - The sharpening of trend lines for capital areas suggests that the socio-economic status of these regions has become increasingly polarized over time, with some areas showing notable improvement while others have declined.
    

**Trend Analysis**

Parallel Coordinate Plot of IRSD and (W)LIRSD for Greater Capital Cities (GCC) over Years
:::

- In ACT and Greater Sydney, there is a modest decline in the IRSD, which is not mirrored
in the (W)LIRSD scores, indicating that the socio-economic status of these areas has improved over time, but the relative level within each time period declined

- In non-capital areas of NT, there is decreasing trend in the IRSD, but increasing trend in the (W)LIRSD, indicating that the socio-economic status of these areas has improved over time, and the relative level within each time period became worse (other areas improved more than these areas)

:::{.notes}

This scatter plot compares the original IRSD with the new L-IRSD and WL-IRSD scores at the SA2 level. The diagonal line represents where scores are equal; points above indicate higher L-IRSD/WL-IRSD scores, while points below indicate lower scores.

In 2006, trend lines for both capital and non-capital areas are close to the diagonal, but they diverge over time. For non-capital areas, the flatter trend line suggests that high-disadvantage areas have seen some improvement. In contrast, the steeper trend line for capital areas indicates increasing socio-economic differences within these regions.

The parallel coordinate plot further highlights these trends. While socio-economic status in ACT and Greater Sydney has generally improved, their relative standing within each period has declined. Conversely, non-capital areas in the Northern Territory have shown improvement but have worsened in relative position over time.

## Applications

- Not only the (W)LIRSD, but also the PC2 of each of them can be used as covariates in the models.

- There are two series of models can be built:

    - **Spatial Models within one period**: 
    
    We want to explore the validity of the (W)LIRSD and PC2 in capturing the socio-economic status of areas within one period. The (W)LIRSD will be used as a covariate in the models comparing to use the IRSD. The PC2 will be used as a covariate in the models comparing to use the ARIA index.
    
    - **Spatio-Temporal Models across four period**:
    
    We want to validate the (W)LIRSD on capturing the socio-economic status of areas across different periods. The (W)LIRSD will be used as a covariate in the models comparing to use the IRSD. No other covariates will be used in the models.

:::{.notes}

Based on our analysis, we designed two sets of models to explore applications of the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD indices.

The first series focuses on spatial models within a single period. Here, we aim to validate the effectiveness of our new indices, not only the L-IRSD but also PC2, which shows potential in capturing unique aspects of socio-economic status. We will compare the L-IRSD, WL-IRSD, and PC2 to the IRSD and ARIA index as covariates in these models.

The second series involves spatio-temporal models across periods to validate the indices’ consistency over time. For this, we’ll use the L-IRSD and WL-IRSD as the sole covariates and compare them with the IRSD across different periods.

:::


### Data

Other than IRSD and (W)LIRSD, two other datasets will be used in the models.

- **The Australia Early Development Census (AEDC)**: The AEDC is a national census of early childhood development in Australia. It provides a snapshot of how children have developed by the time they start their first year of full-time school. It is conducted every three years from 2009, and consists of five domains: `physical health and well-being`, `social competence`, `emotional maturity`, `language and cognitive skills`, and `communication skills and general knowledge`.

- **Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA)**: The ARIA is a measure of the relative access to services in different parts of Australia. It is based on the road distance to different types of services, such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers. The ARIA can be grouped into five categories: `major cities`, `inner regional`, `outer regional`, `remote`, and `very remote`. However, in this study, we will use the continuous ARIA index in 2016.

:::{.notes}

Our model data includes the IRSD, L-IRSD, and WL-IRSD indices, along with two additional datasets: the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) and the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA).

The AEDC offers insights into early childhood development across five key domains, while the ARIA measures access to services across Australia. We believe ARIA can serve as an alternative indicator to capture urban-rural differences in socio-economic status.

### Model Comparison I: Spatial Models within one period

**Model specification**

Following the methodologies of @cramb2018investigation, @li2020bayesian, and @mollie1996bayesian, this study applies a **Bayesian hierarchical model** to smooth observed estimates of childhood vulnerability. This model is specifically designed to account for socio-economic disparities, spatial variations, and unobserved factors that may affect estimate accuracy. We choose **Leroux spatial model** as the spatial structure in the model, which is a popular choice in spatial modeling due to its flexibility and computational efficiency [@leroux2000estimation].

: Estimated regression coefficient, standard deviation parameter, and model information criteria (DIC, WAIC, LOOIC, ELPD) for the developed models M1 to M4 for prevalence of vulnerability in **Communication Skills and General Knowledge** domain {#tbl-model-01-communication}

</div>


- All models were fitted for each of the five AEDC domains, with the best results occurring in the Communication Skills and General Knowledge domain, as shown in @tbl-model-01-communication.

- The results indicate that the (W)LIRSD and PC2 are stronger predictors of childhood vulnerability than the IRSD and ARIA, as reflected by lower DIC, WAIC, and LOOIC values.

- PC2 is more significant in the model than ARIA, suggesting that PC2 may be a more suitable covariate for remoteness. This may be because ARIA is skewed toward major cities, whereas PC2 is more evenly distributed across different levels.

- Combination of (W)LIRSD and PC2 as predictors in the model works best in terms of lower variations while still achieving strong correlation with the observed data on non-capital areas

:::{.notes}

We won’t dive into the formulas here. Our model uses a Bayesian hierarchical approach with spatial structure to smooth estimates of childhood vulnerability, accounting for both covariates and spatial variations.

We compared four models: M1 and M2 as benchmarks, using IRSD and ARIA as covariates, and M3 and M4 using the new indices (W)LIRSD and PC2 as covariates.

Good models are identified by information criteria like DIC, WAIC, and LOOIC. Our results show that (W)LIRSD and PC2 outperform IRSD and ARIA as predictors of childhood vulnerability.

The Taylor diagram illustrates the balance between variance and bias, showing that M4 reduces variation while maintaining strong correlation with observed data, especially in non-capital areas.

### Model Comparison II: Spatio-Temporal Models on multiple periods

**Model specification**

As AEDC is not always matched with the census year, when the spatio-temporal models was built, the IRSD and (W)LIRSD will be used as applied the cubic spline interpolation to the time variable from 2006 to 2021 to match them with the AEDC data in 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021.

The Bayesian hierarchical model with spatio-temporal structured random effects will be used to on small area estimation on childhood vulnerability. Random effect will be decomposed into three components: spatially structured, temporally structured, and unstructured random effects [@knorr2000bayesian].

</div>

- We only show the results of the Communication Skills and General Knowledge domain in @tbl-model-02-communication, and the results of other domains are similar

- (W)LIRSD works better than IRSD, while the combination of (W)LIRSD and PC2 works the best

- This may be because the (W)LIRSD and PC2 are more sensitive to the socio-economic status of the areas in different periods than the IRSD

:::{.notes}

n the spatio-temporal models, we applied cubic spline interpolation to align the AEDC data with census years. The models use (W)LIRSD and PC2 as covariates to capture fixed effects, with random effects divided into spatially structured, temporally structured, and unstructured components.

We compared three models: M1 as a benchmark using IRSD, and M2 and M3 using (W)LIRSD and PC2 as covariates. The results indicate that (W)LIRSD and PC2 are more effective predictors of childhood vulnerability than IRSD, demonstrating greater sensitivity to socio-economic status changes over time.

A variance-bias test confirms that M3 performs best, showing lower variation and strong correlation with observed data, particularly in non-capital areas.

An advantage of spatio-temporal models is their ability to analyze trends. While we’ll skip the detailed analysis here, I’d like to highlight that these models provide narrow credibility intervals, which help identify significant changes in childhood vulnerability over time.

Additionally, we can calculate the Annual Percentage Change (APC) with credibility intervals and map significant changes across Australia and capital regions. The results show that the model effectively identifies areas with notable increases or decreases in vulnerability.

## Conclusion on Part One 

- A historical review of the ABS's IRSD reveals shifts in the socio-economic status norms of areas over time, captured by tracking variable loadings on the IRSD

- The new index, (W)LIRSD, effectively captures changes in socio-economic status over time and reveals different types of socio-economic disadvantage by incorporating PC2

- The combination of (W)LIRSD and PC2 serves as a better predictor of childhood vulnerability than IRSD and ARIA, demonstrating the new index's effectiveness in capturing socio-economic status in applications

- The spatio-temporal models indicate that (W)LIRSD is more sensitive to socio-economic status across different periods than IRSD. The combination of (W)LIRSD and PC2 performs even better, demonstrating the new index's ability to capture socio-economic status variations over time in applications

:::{.notes}

In conclusion, our study highlights four key findings and contributions:

Our historical review of the IRSD showed how socio-economic conditions have shifted over time, with variable loadings reflecting these changes.

We developed the new (W)LIRSD index, which tracks socio-economic changes effectively. Adding PC2 provides a more detailed view of different types of socio-economic disadvantage.

We demonstrated that (W)LIRSD and PC2 are stronger predictors of childhood vulnerability than IRSD and ARIA in some case, showing the new index’s practical value.

Finally, our spatio-temporal models show that (W)LIRSD is more sensitive to changes over time than IRSD, with (W)LIRSD and PC2 together capturing these shifts even better.

# Part Two: Bivariate Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling with Copula-based Spatial Dependence Using Conditional Autoregressive Frameworks

## Backgrounds

- Disease mapping has become a critical tool for identifying high-risk areas, tracking disease trends, and understanding disparities within and across populations, which requires the development of spatial models [@persaud2021united].

- **Bayesian hierarchical models** (BHMs) are a popular choice for disease mapping due to their ability to account for spatial dependence, unobserved heterogeneity, and measurement error. However, bivariate BHMs are less common, despite the importance of understanding the relationship between two diseases or health outcomes.
    - The **spatial dependence** in BHMs is often modeled using conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors, as it assumes that near things are more related.
    - The **copula** function is used to model the joint distribution of two random variables, which can capture the dependence structure between the two variables. Traditional spatial models only use bivariate normal distribution to model the joint distribution, which may not be flexible enough to capture the complex dependence structure between two diseases [@nelsen2006introduction].


:::{.notes}

The second part of my research focuses on bivariate Bayesian hierarchical modeling with copula-based spatial dependence using a conditional autoregressive framework.

It involves many terminologies that may be new to you, so I will try to explain them in simple terms.

When we have a small sample size, we often want to "borrow strength" to improve estimation accuracy. Besides selecting good covariates, as we did in Part One, we can also assume specific structures in the data to enhance our estimates.

In this research, we focus on two main structures: spatial dependence and copula functions.

For spatial dependence, we assume that outcomes in nearby areas are more related. This is a common assumption in spatial modeling, where the location and neighborhood relationships play a role in predictions.

In a bivariate model, we model two outcomes at the same time. Traditional models assume a simple, multivariate normal structure for their dependence, but this may not fully capture the complexity of relationships between outcomes, like between two diseases.

By using these assumptions, our models aim to provide more accurate estimations in cases where data relationships are complex.

## Reviews on Bivariate BHMs, Spatial Dependence, and Copula Functions

- **Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHMs)**: Bayesian models can be complex and flexible (than frequentest models) as they can incorporate prior information, can (always) be fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

- **Spatial Effects and CAR Priors**: Spatial effects are the effects of the location of the area on the outcome, where near areas are more related. The CAR prior is a popular choice for spatial effects in BHMs, as it can capture the spatial dependence between areas by assuming the conditional distribution of the outcome in one area depends on the outcomes in neighboring areas.

- **Copulas**: Copulas are a powerful tool for modeling the joint distribution of two or more random variables by decoupling the marginal distributions from the dependence structure.

:::{.notes}

In this part of the research, we’ll cover three main topics:

Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHMs) – These models help us analyze complex data, especially when data is limited. They use prior information and are fitted with MCMC methods, which provide accurate estimates.

Spatial Effects and CAR Priors – Spatial effects mean that nearby areas tend to have similar outcomes. CAR priors are used to model this, assuming each area is influenced by its neighbors.

Copulas – Copulas let us model the relationship between multiple variables separately from their individual distributions, which helps capture complex dependencies.

:::


### Bayesian Hierarchical Models

- The Bayesian models assumes the parameters in the model are random variables, and the prior distribution of the parameters are specified. The posterior distribution of the parameters can be obtained by Bayes' theorem, and the MCMC methods can be used to sample from the posterior distribution.

- The hierarchical structure in the model allows the parameters to vary across different levels, where the prior of the former level is the posterior of the latter level

    - **Data Layer**: Observed data are modeled as random variables conditional on the parameters
    - **Process Layer**: Parameters from the data layer are modeled as random variables conditional on their own distributions. This layer can be hierarchically structured to capture different levels of variation in the data
    - **Prior Layer**: Priors of the parameters in the process layer are specifed through hyperparameters, which can be fixed or random variables themselves.

**Formula of Bayesian Hierarchical Models in General**
$$
  y_i | \mu_i \sim \mathcal{D}(Y_i | \mu_i)
$$
$$
  \quad g(\mu_i) = \boldsymbol{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon_i 
$$
$$
  \boldsymbol{\beta} \sim \text{Gaussian}(\boldsymbol{\mu_{\beta}}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\beta}}) \quad \text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{D_{\epsilon}}(\dots)
$$

:::{.notes}

Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHMs) are a powerful tool for analyzing complex data. They treat model parameters as random variables with specified prior distributions. Using MCMC methods, we can sample from the parameters’ posterior distributions.

One key advantage of BHMs is their hierarchical structure, allowing parameters to vary at different levels. The model has three layers: the data layer for observed data, the process layer for parameters, and the prior layer for parameter priors.

The diagram above illustrates a general BHM setup, where Y is explained by a combination of covariates (x) and random errors (epsilon). The parameters beta and epsilon are also modeled as random variables with their own distributions.

### Spatial Effects and CAR Priors

#### Spatial Effects

- **Neighborhood matrix**: The spatial structure of the data can be represented by a neighborhood matrix, where the elements of the matrix indicate whether two areas are neighbors or not.

- **Spatial autocorrelation**: The spatial autocorrelation is the correlation between the outcomes and its neighbors (named spatial lag), which can be captured by the CAR prior.

![Prevalence of Vulnerability in Physical Health and Wellbeing in Greater Sydney by SA3, 2021](notebooks/figures/spatial/fig-syd-lisa-sa3-1.png){#fig-spatial-lisa}

- **Spatial autocorrelation in models**: The spatial autocorrelation occurs in the residuals of the model, shows the remaining spatial effects that can not be caputred by the covariates in the model

:::

#### Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Priors

- The CAR prior is a popular choice for spatial effects in BHMs, as it can capture the spatial dependence between areas by assuming the conditional distribution of the outcome in one area depends on the outcomes in neighboring areas.

- The structure of the CAR prior is not unique, and it can be defined based on the neighborhood matrix of the data. The most common CAR prior are Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive (ICAR) and Besag-York-Mollie (BYM), and **Leroux prior** [@leroux2000estimation].

- Brook's Lemma help with converting conditional distribution to joint distribution, which is the key for CAR model to be fit [@brook1964distinction].

:::{.notes}

Spatial effects occur when nearby areas have similar outcomes, shown by spatial autocorrelation in the model’s residuals. Neighborhood matrices define these relationships, while spatial lag helps identify the size and location of these effects.

It’s important to note that spatial effects can appear not only in the observed data but also in covariates and residuals. This means spatial patterns in Y may not be fully captured by the covariates alone.

The CAR prior is commonly used in BHMs to model spatial effects. It assumes that an area’s outcome depends on its neighbors, using conditional distributions to represent this relationship. Brook's Lemma is key in CAR models, converting conditional distributions into joint distributions, which is essential for fitting the model.

### Copulas

- **Copulas** are a powerful tool for modeling the joint distribution of two or more random variables by decoupling the marginal distributions from the dependence structure 

- Different choice of copulas can capture different types of dependence structure, such as Gaussian copula Clayton copula, and Gumbel copula [@genest1993statistical]

- Dependence structure, not only the correlation, but also the shape (asymmetric or symmetric) and the tail (heavy or light) of the joint distribution

## Model Development - Bivariate Bayesian Hierarchical Models with Copula-based Spatial Dependence

- New model was developed based on the framework of bivariate Bayesian hierarchical models with Leroux spatial structure, can be denoted as **"Cop-leroux model"**, we only show model specification briefly here.

- The model can be fitted by MCMC methods, and random effects can be simulated by Gibbs sampling. The algorithm will not be shown here.

- R Package `CARBayesCopula` was established and public available on GitHub for convenient install. The core algorithm of the model was written in `Rcpp` for computational efficiency

### R Package `CARBayesCopula`


- The R package `CARBayesCopula` is a flexible and efficient tool for fitting bivariate Bayesian hierarchical models with copula-based spatial dependence using the Leroux spatial structure. It was developed based the framework of `CARBayes` package [@lee2013carbayes]

- The core simulation algorithm is written in `Rcpp` [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] for computational efficiency, and the package provides functions for model diagnostics in LOOIC [@vehtari2020loo], DIC, and WAIC.

- The choice of copula function are "Gaussian", "Clayton", "Gumbel", "Frank" and "Joe". 

- Open to public by GitHub (and CRAN after the review)

[https://github.com/MoooooLee/CARBayesCopula](https://github.com/MoooooLee/CARBayesCopula)


## Applications

- Models were fitted and validated on the AEDC data in 2021, and the results were compared to the traditional bivariate Leroux model without copula-based dependence

- To make the comparison simple, the covariates in the models are the same, which is the IRSD in 2021. As models are bivariate, both the outcomes and the fitted coefficients in two dimensions

- Among five domains of AEDC, the results of bivariate model on the `Emotional Maturity` and `Language and Cognitive Skills` domains are shown here. Among 10 pairs of model, not all of them give the better results than the traditional Leroux model, but some of them do.

### Bivariate Model Results

![Spatial Distribution of the Prevalence of Vulnerability in Emotional Maturity and Language and Cognitive Skills of Children by SA3, 2021](notebooks/figures/B02_prevalence_map.png){#fig-bivar-map}

- High prevalence of vulnerability in `Emotional Maturity` and `Language and Cognitive Skills` tends to cluster in remote areas

- Melbourne and Sydney tends to have lower prevalence of vulnerability in `Emotional Maturity` but higher in `Language and Cognitive Skills`

- Brisbane and Adelaide tends to have higher prevalence of vulnerability in `Emotional Maturity` but lower in `Language and Cognitive Skills`


## Conclusion on Part Two

- Residuals of two outcomes are not only spatially autocorrelated, but also have a complex dependence structure, which can be plotted by empirical copulas

- The bivariate Bayesian hierarchical models with copula-based spatial dependence using the Leroux spatial structure can capture the complex dependence structure between two outcomes, and the results show that the copula-based models can outperform the traditional bivariate Leroux model in some cases

- Bivariate model can be used to give more insights on the relationship between two outcomes, which may help to understand the underlying mechanisms of the outcomes and to develop more effective interventions

- The R package `CARBayesCopula`, make this model more accessible to researchers and practitioners

### PCA steps {.unnumbered}

PCA is a statistical method that can be used to reduce the dimensional of a dataset by transforming the data into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

1. Standardize the data
$$
        Z_{i,j} = \frac{Y_{i,j} - \bar{y}_{j}}{s_j}
$$

    In the case of PCA with weights, the standardized value need to be weighted by the corresponding weight, where the mean and standard deviation are calculated based on the weighted data. Here we list the simple formula for the weighted mean and standard deviation. 
$$
    \bar{y}_{j} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i Y_{i,j}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \quad \quad s_{j} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (Y_{i,j} - \bar{y}_{j})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}}
$$ 

2. Calculate the covariance matrix

    The empirical covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ is a $p \times p$ matrix that captures the pairwise relationships between variables. 
    In the case of PCA with weights, the covariance matrix is computed based on the weighted standardized data:
$$
    C_{j,k} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i Z_{i,j} Z_{i,k}
$$

3. Eigenvalue Decomposition

    The third step in PCA is to perform an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ yields a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, while the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector. The eigenvectors are arranged in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. Here we denote the $k$th eigenvector as $\mathbf{v}_{k}$, and the $k$th eigenvalue is denoted as $\lambda_{k}$.

4. Principal Component Scores

    The fourth step in PCA is to compute the principal component scores. The principal component scores represent the linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum amount of variance in the data. The $k$th principal component score for the $i$th observation can be calculated as: 
$$
    PC_{i,k} = \sum_{j=1}^{p} \alpha_{j,k} Z_{i,j}
$$

    where $\alpha_{j,k}$ is the loading of the $j$th variable on the $k$th principal component, can be calculated from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The formula for the loading is: 
$$
    \alpha_{j,k} = \sqrt{\lambda_{k}} v_{j,k}
$$ 

    where $v_{j,k}$ is the $j$th element of the $k$th eigenvector and the $\lambda_{k}$ is the $k$th eigenvalue as we mentioned in the previous step.


### Taylor Diagram {.unnumbered}

The trade-off between variance and bias can be always the key point in the model estimation. The Taylor diagram is a graphical method to visualize the trade-off. The good estimation should have lower variance and bias, where the estimation should have high correlation with the observed data.

High variation with no bias may indicate that the model is overfitting the data, while low variation with high bias may indicate that the model is underfitting the data.

![Taylor Diagram on Simulated Data](notebooks/figures/Model_01/H02_TaylorDiagram_Example.png){#fig-taylor-example}

As we can see that model A should be the worst model, as it just predict the mean of the data, which has no variance but high bias. Model D faces the overfitting issue, as it has high variance but low bias. Model B and C are the good models, as they have lower variance and bias, and high correlation with the observed data.


### Model Specification of Cop-leroux {.unnumbered }

**Bivariate copula-based Leroux model with binomial data layer**

A bivariate copula-based Leroux model with the binomial data layer can be described as the following set of equations.

<div style="font-size: 0.6em;">

\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{y_A} \sim Bin(\boldsymbol{n_A}, \boldsymbol{p_A}) \quad &\text{and} \quad \boldsymbol{y_B} \sim Bin(\boldsymbol{n_B}, \boldsymbol{p_B}) \\
    logit(\boldsymbol{p_A}) = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta_A} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon_A} \quad &\text{and} \quad logit(\boldsymbol{p_B}) = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta_B} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon_B} \\
    (\boldsymbol{\epsilon_A, \boldsymbol{\epsilon_B}}) &= (\boldsymbol{\phi_A}, \boldsymbol{\phi_B})\\
    \boldsymbol{\phi_A} | \rho, \phi_{A,-j}, \boldsymbol{W}, \tau_A &\sim N \left( \frac{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} \phi_{A,i}}{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} +1-\rho}, \frac{\tau_A^2}{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} +1-\rho} \right) \\
    \boldsymbol{\phi_B} | \rho, \phi_{B,-j}, \boldsymbol{W}, \tau_B &\sim N \left( \frac{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} \phi_{B,i}}{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} +1-\rho}, \frac{\tau_B^2}{\rho \sum_{i=1}^{K}w_{ji} +1-\rho} \right) \\
    (\boldsymbol{\phi_A}, \boldsymbol{\phi_B}) | \alpha &\sim Cop(\boldsymbol{\phi_A}, \boldsymbol{\phi_B}, C(\alpha))\\
\end{align}

</div>


Here $\boldsymbol{y_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{y_B}$ represent the observed data for the two components of the bivariate model, with $\boldsymbol{n_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{n_B}$ as the corresponding trial numbers. The probability vectors $\boldsymbol{p_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{p_B}$ are modeled using logit link functions with covariates $\boldsymbol{X}$ and regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta_B}$, respectively.


The random effects $\boldsymbol{\epsilon_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon_B}$ are assumed to be determined by the structured components $\boldsymbol{\phi_A}$ and $\boldsymbol{\phi_B}$, which are modeled as conditional autoregressive (CAR) effects. The marginal distributions of the structured components are assumed to follow normal distributions with spatial dependencies captured by the spatial dependence parameter $\rho$, the neighborhood matrix $\boldsymbol{W}$, and the precision parameters $\tau_A$ and $\tau_B$. While the joint distribution of the structured components is modeled using a copula function $C(\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ representing the copula parameter.
